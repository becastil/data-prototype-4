| Metric | Calculated | Provided | Difference | Status |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------|--------|
| Average Subscribers | 1574.75 | 1575 | 0.25 | ✅ PASS |

**Calculation:** Sum of all monthly subscribers (18,897) ÷ 12 months = 1574.75

## Key Features Validated

### 1. ✅ Column Name Flexibility
- System accepts user's preferred column names
- Automatically maps to internal database fields
- No need to match exact system names

### 2. ✅ Negative Value Handling
- Negative values in "Spec Stop Los Est" correctly interpreted as reimbursements
- Negative values in "Rx Rebate" correctly interpreted as rebates
- Both reduce total costs as expected

### 3. ✅ Automatic Sum Row Detection
- System automatically detects rows with "sum", "total", or "average" in Month column
- Sum rows excluded from data import
- Used only for validation purposes

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Validation
- All monetary fields validated against calculated sums
- Tolerance of $1.00 for rounding differences
- Average subscriber calculation validated separately
- Tolerance of 1 subscriber for rounding

### 5. ✅ Clear Error Reporting
When validation fails, system provides:
- Exact field that failed
- Calculated value
- Provided value
- Difference amount

## Initial Test: Error Detection

During initial testing, the validation **correctly identified an error** in the test data:

**Error Found:** Rx Paid sum had a $1,000 discrepancy
- Calculated: $566,550.00
- Provided: $565,550.00 (incorrect)
- Difference: $1,000.00

This proves the validation logic is working correctly! ✅
